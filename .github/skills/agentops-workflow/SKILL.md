# AgentOps Workflow

Help the user wire AgentOps into a real GenAIOps GitFlow CI/CD setup with
three environments (`dev`, `qa`, `production`) and an automatic eval gate
on every change.

This skill produces four workflow files via `agentops workflow generate`
and then walks the user through the GitHub-side configuration (OIDC,
environments, branch protection, deploy step).

## Branch model assumed

```
feature/* ── PR ──▶ develop                 [agentops-pr.yml]      gate
                       │
                       └── merge ─▶ develop  [agentops-deploy-dev.yml]   build + eval + deploy DEV
release/* ── push                            [agentops-deploy-qa.yml]    build + eval + deploy QA
release/* ── PR ──▶ main                     [agentops-pr.yml]      gate
                       │
                       └── merge ─▶ main     [agentops-deploy-prod.yml]  safety eval + build + deploy PROD
```

If the user is on trunk-based development, omit `qa` and `release/**`
and have them generate `--kinds pr,dev,prod`.

## Step 0 — Prerequisites

1. `pip install "agentops-toolkit @ git+https://github.com/Azure/agentops.git@develop"` if `agentops` is missing.
2. `agentops.yaml` exists at the project root and `agentops eval run`
   works locally.
3. The user's repo follows GitFlow (or is willing to). If not, ask which
   branches map to dev/qa/prod and adjust the `on:` triggers after
   generation.

## Step 1 — Generate the workflows

```bash
agentops workflow generate
```

This writes **four** files into `.github/workflows/`:

| File | Trigger | Environment |
|---|---|---|
| `agentops-pr.yml` | PRs to `develop`, `release/**`, `main` | (none) |
| `agentops-deploy-dev.yml` | push to `develop` | `dev` |
| `agentops-deploy-qa.yml` | push to `release/**` | `qa` |
| `agentops-deploy-prod.yml` | push to `main` | `production` |

Useful flags:

- `--force` — overwrite existing workflow files.
- `--kinds pr,dev,qa,prod` — generate a subset (e.g. `--kinds pr,dev,prod`
  for trunk-based teams).
- `--dir <path>` — non-default repo root.

## Step 2 — Configure GitHub Environments

Walk the user through Settings → Environments and create three:

1. **`dev`** — no extra protection. Set any DEV-specific variables here
   (e.g. `ACA_APP_NAME`, `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` pointing at the dev RG).
2. **`qa`** — usually no required reviewers, but isolated variables for
   the QA environment.
3. **`production`** — set:
   - **Required reviewers**: at least one (deploys to PROD will pause
     here until approved).
   - (Optional) **Wait timer** for an extra delay.
   - (Optional) **Deployment branches**: restrict to `main`.
   - PROD-specific variables (e.g. production resource group).

Tell the user that env-specific variables on the `production` environment
will override repo-level ones automatically inside the prod workflow.

## Step 3 — Configure repository variables for OIDC

At repository level (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
**Variables** tab), set:

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` — App registration / managed identity used for OIDC.
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
- `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` — Foundry project URL used by the
  eval step.

Then configure Workload Identity Federation on the Azure side
(`federated-credentials` on the app registration) for **each branch /
environment** the workflows will run from. See
`docs/ci-github-actions.md` for the exact `az` commands.

## Step 4 — Fill in the Build and Deploy placeholders

Each `agentops-deploy-*.yml` has a `Build (placeholder)` and a
`Deploy (placeholder)` step. The dev template includes commented
example snippets for the most common stacks. Replace them based on
the user's stack:

- **Container Apps** — replace Build with `az acr build` and Deploy
  with `az containerapp update --image ...`.
- **App Service** — replace Build with the package step, Deploy with
  `azure/webapps-deploy@v3`.
- **Foundry hosted agent** — Build is typically empty; Deploy publishes
  a new agent version (project-specific tooling).
- **azd-managed app** — replace Build with `azd package` and Deploy
  with `azd deploy --no-prompt` (set `AZURE_ENV_NAME` per environment).

Don't invent commands you can't see in the user's repo. If the stack
isn't obvious, ask.

## Step 5 — Branch protection

In Settings → Branches, add a rule for both `develop` and `main`:

- Require a pull request before merging.
- Require status checks to pass: select **`AgentOps PR / Eval (PR gate)`**
  (the job name from `agentops-pr.yml`).
- Optional: require linear history.

This makes the eval gate a hard merge requirement.

## Step 6 — Iterate

Common follow-ups:

- **Tighten thresholds for QA/PROD** — copy `agentops.yaml` to
  `agentops-qa.yaml` / `agentops-prod.yaml` and tighten the
  `thresholds:` block. Point each workflow at its own config via the
  `inputs.config` default.
- **Scheduled runs** — add a `schedule:` entry in `agentops-pr.yml` (or a
  new `agentops-nightly.yml`) to evaluate against `main` nightly.
- **Matrix per scenario** — if the user has multiple AgentOps config files,
  extend the eval job with `strategy.matrix.config:` and reference
  `${{ matrix.config }}`.
- **Regression baseline** — wire the deploy templates to download the
  previous run's `results.json` artifact and call
  `agentops eval run --baseline <results.json>`.

## Guardrails

- Do **not** invent CLI flags. The supported `workflow generate` flags
  are `--force`, `--dir`, `--kinds`.
- Do **not** create parallel workflow files. Prefer editing the
  generated ones.
- Do **not** auto-fill Build/Deploy with steps you can't justify from
  the user's existing code. Ask before guessing.
- The four workflow names (`agentops-pr`, `agentops-deploy-dev`,
  `agentops-deploy-qa`, `agentops-deploy-prod`) are fixed — don't rename
  them or branch-protection wiring will break.
